# Control Flow

## If Statement

Use `input` to prompt user for how many months this project will take:

Create an if/elif/else statement that prints:

- "That's a long project! You may want to break it up into phases." if it's more than 12 months

- "Okay, that's a reasonable length." if it's longer than 3 months

- "That's a quick project." if it's shorter than 3 months

- Given that it's between 3 and 12 months, check if it's longer than 6 months. If so, print: "You may want to consider adding another resource to speed it up."


## Looping
1. Construct a list of numbers between 0 and 200 that are divisible by 33

2. Given the cleaned departments list from earlier:
["Operations", "Sales", "Finance", "HR", "Engineering", "Compliance"]
Get the sum of all of the lengths of these strings.
