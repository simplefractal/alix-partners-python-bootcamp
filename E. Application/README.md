## Break-even analysis

You want to do some break-even analysis for your consultancy.

Write a function `compute_breakeven_point` that takes as input:
 - `fixed_costs`
 - `unit_cost`
 - `unit_income`

1. Compute the minimum number of consultants that need to be staffed to break even on cost.

2. Introduce an optional argument `num_consultants` that assumes your team size is fixed. Modify your function to work in both cases.

3. If the answer exceeds `num_consultants`, then print an appropriate error message saying that you cannot break even with the current team size.

If stuck, consider the following techinques:
1. Write down in plain English what you want to do, step by step using comments (prefix each line with `#`)
2. Perform wishful programming by using variables before you define them.
