# Why Python over Excel?
- Repeatability: You can rerun a Python script consistently whereas Excel is more brittle to data updates.
- Transparency: Code is transparent and detailed whereas Excel often loses the audit trail.
- Scalability: size of data has changed drastically in the last couple of decades and Excel has trouble keeping up.
- Collaboration: Python can leverage git version control whereas Excel versioning easily gets messy.

# Why Python over SQL?
- Versatility: Python can use web data, text data, csv data, etc. whereas SQL is limited to SQL databases.
- Control: Python controls how to manipulate data whereas SQL controls what data to retrieve/update.
- Extensibility: Python has a wide range of libraries whereas SQL tools are more limited.
